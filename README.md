# RestaurantSimDriverApplication
Using the Google maps API, specifically the Routes API, I will calculate the optimal route for a given set of orders given by the restaurant. (The restaurant being another project I am working on that can be found in my repository). This app will incorporate an in progress status for each order the driver is actively working/ driving to.
